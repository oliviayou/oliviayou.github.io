                About Me
            </h2></mark>
            <p>
                In high school, I enjoyed learning math, science and business, but was unsure how those skills could be applied
                to industry. I ended up choosing to study <strong>Management Engineering</strong> ‚Äî a program that brings 
                together the technological problem-solving ability of engineering with operational decision-making skills 
                in management in order to optimize the performance of products and systems. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                Through the technical skills I learned, people I met, and internships I am grateful to have had, I 
                discovered my interest in building software solutions - I am excited to solve technical problems and overcome 
                challenges along the way. My latest internships were all within the realms of software engineering and I 
                plan to further explore these areas!
            </p>
            <p>
