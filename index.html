                I'm an Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I've worked in various engineering roles at <strong>TD</strong> and at <strong>TribalScale</strong>, 
                with work ranging from QA and design to software development and engineering. 
                <br><br>I'm currently working as a Software Developer at <strong>RBC</strong>, while dabbling in web development 
                projects and advancing my skills through a <b><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">machine learning
                course</a></b> in the evenings.
            <br><br>In a nutshell, I genuinely enjoy learning and building stuff that offer awesome user experiences 🌍

                About Me
            </h2></mark>
            <p> 
                I'm studying <strong>Management Engineering</strong> — a program that brings together the technological problem-solving ability of 
                engineering with operational decision making skills in management in order to optimize the performance of products and systems.
            </p>
            <p> 
                To apply these learnings, I’ve worked with incredibly smart people at TribalScale and most recently at TD Bank.
                While working at two very different companies and teams, I was involved with <strong>Agile Transformation</strong> in both cases. 
                I look forward to attending lunch & learns, lean coffees and even running retrospectives amongst other Agile ceremonies!
            </p>
            <p> 
                Outside school and work:
                <ul>
                    <li>I mentor first year engineering students 📚</li>
                    <li>I enjoy playing volleyball 🏐, basketball 🏀 and running 🏃🏻‍♀️</li>
                    <li>I actively keep up with the news and occasionally trade stocks 📈</li>
                    <li>I love trying new foods, drinks and bubble tea 😂 & bake in my spare time 🍞</li>
                    <li>I'm a hackathon attender and organizer 👩🏻‍💻</li>
                </ul>
